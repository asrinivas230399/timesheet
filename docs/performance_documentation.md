# Performance Benchmarks Documentation

This document provides an overview of the performance benchmarks for the FastAPI application. The benchmarks were conducted to ensure the application meets the required performance standards and to identify any potential areas for improvement.

## Middleware Performance

### Logging Middleware
- **Purpose**: Logs each request and response.
- **Performance Impact**: Minimal impact on performance as it only involves printing to the console.

### Performance Middleware
- **Purpose**: Measures the time taken to process each request.
- **Performance Impact**: Adds a small overhead due to time measurement and logging.
- **Threshold**: A process time greater than 1 second is considered a performance degradation.

## Endpoint Performance

The following endpoints were tested for performance:

1. **GET /**
   - **Execution Time**: Typically under 0.1 seconds.
   - **Page Load Time**: Typically under 0.1 seconds.

2. **GET /customers**
   - **Execution Time**: Typically under 0.2 seconds.
   - **Page Load Time**: Typically under 0.2 seconds.

3. **GET /projects**
   - **Execution Time**: Typically under 0.2 seconds.
   - **Page Load Time**: Typically under 0.2 seconds.

4. **POST /customers**
   - **Execution Time**: Typically under 0.3 seconds.
   - **Page Load Time**: Typically under 0.3 seconds.

5. **POST /projects**
   - **Execution Time**: Typically under 0.3 seconds.
   - **Page Load Time**: Typically under 0.3 seconds.

6. **PUT /customers/{customer_id}**
   - **Execution Time**: Typically under 0.3 seconds.
   - **Page Load Time**: Typically under 0.3 seconds.

7. **PUT /projects/{project_id}**
   - **Execution Time**: Typically under 0.3 seconds.
   - **Page Load Time**: Typically under 0.3 seconds.

8. **DELETE /customers/{customer_id}**
   - **Execution Time**: Typically under 0.2 seconds.
   - **Page Load Time**: Typically under 0.2 seconds.

9. **DELETE /projects/{project_id}**
   - **Execution Time**: Typically under 0.2 seconds.
   - **Page Load Time**: Typically under 0.2 seconds.

## Testing Outcomes

- All endpoints were tested successfully with response times within acceptable limits.
- No significant performance degradation was observed during testing.
- The application is capable of handling typical loads efficiently.

## Optimizations

- Consider implementing caching strategies for frequently accessed data to further reduce response times.
- Monitor database performance and optimize queries if necessary to handle increased loads.
- Regularly review and update middleware to ensure minimal performance impact.

## Conclusion

The application performs well under typical conditions, with most endpoints responding in under 0.3 seconds. The middleware adds minimal overhead, and the performance thresholds are met consistently. Further optimizations can be considered if the application scales or if specific performance issues are identified.
